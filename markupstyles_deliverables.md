## MARKUP AND STYLES 

###HTML AND CSS

* SWBAT identify the roles of HTML (content), CSS (styles), and JS (interaction), in the creation of a website and recognize and remedy classic antipatterns that demonstrate a conflation of these roles.

* SWBAT write and recognize the syntax of element, id, class, and compound selectors and understand the DOM elements they apply to.

* SWBAT employ specificity and location to properly control the cascade of their style declarations, and articulate this by employing a strategy that quantifies the priority of a selector based on its composition.

* SWBAT position elements using both the float and position attributes, and be able to properly articulate the relationship positioned elements now have with other elements in the DOM.

* SWBAT articulate historical attempts at clear solutions, identify them as anti-patterns, and successfully refactor them to properly implement the semantic cross-browser friendly clear fix. 
* SWBAT employ an understanding of the box model attributes (content, padding, border, margin) to successfully space elements and predict element width and height.

* SWBAT refactor (or DRY up) stylesheets by using inheritance, combining selectors, employing selector abstraction, and using display types.

* SWBAT properly use and identify style shorthand, and be able to articulate when and why to use it.

* SWBAT identify the default display type of any common html and element and be able to explain how and why to use the display attribute to change an elements display type.

* SWBAT center any html element, and be able to articulate why and how the centering technique differs for block vs inline elements.

* SWBAT recognize good vs bad online frontend development resources, and be able to query such resources appropriately to find relevant help.

* SWBAT apply twitter bootstrap, HTML5 boilerplate, and CSS resets to expedite their frontend design experience, while also being able to articulate the tradeoffs these tools introduce.

###WEB DESIGN

* SWBAT define the terms 'progressive enhancement' and 'graceful degradation' and articulate, at a high level, the best practices that compose these guiding principles.

* SWBAT identify responsive web design patterns (fluid grid, @media queries, collapsing navbars) and have a high-level understanding of their implementation.

* SWBAT articulate the specific and unique concerns introduced by designing for mobile devices (screen dimensions, character encoding, performance) and have a high-level understanding of their implementation (user agent sniffing, offline caching).

###SASS

* SWBAT employ SASS as a tool to create maintainable, modular stylesheets by using the variable and mixin features.

* SWBAT write and recognize SASS nested selector syntax and be able to articulate the performance vs readabiliy tradeoffs such a feature allows.

* SWBAT refactor (DRY up) their stylesheets by employing SASS selector inheritance.

* SWBAT architect a directory structure and run the SASS command from the terminal to successfully compile SASS/SCSS to CSS.

* SWBAT architect a Sinatra web application to use SASS and COMPASS to produce CSS.

* SWBAT architect a Rails web application to use SASS and COMPASS to produce CSS.

* SWBAT creating custom SASS helpers

###ERB, HAML, and MARKDOWN

* SWBAT write, read, edit, and debug, basic ERB syntax, including loops, iteration, method calls, and interpolation.

* SWBAT write, read, edit, and debug, basic HAML syntax, including loops, iteration, method calls, and interpolation.

* SWBAT write, read, edit, and debug, basic Markdown syntax, including headings, lists, nested lists, code blocks, and inline code.

* SWBAT employ filters while using HAML to address specific content markup needs.
